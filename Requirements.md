# Govee Smart Light Status Integration - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

A standalone macOS application that integrates with Govee smart lights to provide visual status indicators based on Microsoft Teams presence and Outlook calendar events. The application will automatically change light colors to reflect the user's current availability and upcoming meetings.

## Core User Stories

### Microsoft Teams Integration

**US-001: Teams Status Monitoring**
> As a remote worker, I want my Govee light to automatically change colors based on my Microsoft Teams status (Free, Away, Busy, In a Meeting, Do Not Disturb) so that people in my home office know my availability at a glance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application monitors Microsoft Teams status in real-time
- Light colors change immediately when Teams status changes
- Status changes are reflected within 30 seconds
- Application handles Teams being offline/closed gracefully

**US-002: Customizable Status Colors**  
> As a user, I want to configure which colors represent each Teams status so that I can personalize the lighting to my preferences and environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Settings interface allows color customization for each status
- Color changes are applied immediately upon saving
- Default color scheme is provided out-of-the-box
- Color picker supports full RGB spectrum

### Outlook Calendar Integration

**US-003: Meeting Countdown Notifications**
> As a meeting participant, I want my light to change color as I approach a meeting time (15 min, 5 min, 1 min before) so that I receive visual reminders without needing to check my calendar constantly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application monitors Outlook calendar for upcoming meetings
- Light changes color at configurable time intervals before meetings
- Different colors for different countdown stages
- Only applies to meetings where user is marked as "Busy"

**US-004: Meeting Duration Awareness**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application differentiates between meeting types and durations
- Different color schemes for different meeting categories
- Recurring meeting detection and special handling
- All-day events handled appropriately

### Device Management

**US-005: Govee Device Discovery and Setup**
> As a user, I want to easily connect and configure my Govee smart lights through the application so that I can start using the status integration immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application discovers available Govee devices automatically
- Simple setup wizard for first-time configuration
- Support for multiple Govee devices
- Device connection status monitoring

**US-006: Fallback and Error Handling**
> As a user, I want the application to handle network issues and API failures gracefully so that my workflow isn't disrupted by connectivity problems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Graceful handling of Govee API rate limits
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Clear error notifications when services are unavailable
- Fallback to last known state when appropriate

## Enhanced Features

### System Integration

**US-007: Menu Bar Integration**
> As a macOS user, I want the application to run quietly in the menu bar with quick access to settings and status so that it doesn't clutter my desktop while remaining easily accessible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Minimal menu bar icon showing current status
- Quick toggle for enabling/disabling integration
- Right-click menu for common actions
- Preferences accessible from menu bar

**US-008: Launch at Startup**
> As a daily user, I want the application to start automatically when I log into my Mac so that I don't need to remember to launch it manually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Option to enable/disable startup launch
- Silent startup without showing windows
- Automatic authentication refresh on startup
- Background service initialization

### Advanced Customization

**US-009: Time-Based Overrides**
> As a user with varying schedules, I want to set different lighting behaviors for different times of day (work hours vs evening) so that the integration respects my personal routine.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configurable time-based rules
- Different color schemes for work hours vs personal time
- Weekend vs weekday behavior options
- Holiday/vacation mode

**US-010: Focus Mode Integration**
> As a productivity-focused user, I want the application to integrate with macOS Focus modes so that my lighting reflects both my Teams status and my intentional focus state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detection of active macOS Focus modes
- Custom lighting rules for each Focus mode
- Priority system when multiple states conflict
- Manual override capabilities

### Smart Features

**US-011: Intelligent Meeting Detection**
> As a busy professional, I want the application to intelligently detect when I'm actually in a meeting (not just scheduled) so that the lighting reflects my real availability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detection of active meeting participation
- Different colors for scheduled vs active meetings
- Handling of back-to-back meetings
- Buffer time recognition between meetings

**US-012: Status History and Analytics**
> As a user interested in my work patterns, I want to view basic analytics about my status changes and meeting patterns so that I can understand my availability trends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Simple dashboard showing daily status distribution
- Weekly/monthly meeting frequency trends
- Export data capability
- Privacy-focused local storage only

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Application startup time < 5 seconds
- Status change response time < 30 seconds
- Memory usage < 100MB during normal operation
- CPU usage < 5% during idle state

### Security & Privacy
- Secure OAuth authentication for Microsoft services
- Local storage of credentials using macOS Keychain
- No data transmission to third parties
- Minimal required permissions for Microsoft Graph API

### Compatibility
- macOS 12.0+ (Monterey and later)
- Microsoft 365 Business/Enterprise accounts
- Govee RGBICWW devices (with API support)
- Apple Silicon and Intel Mac support

### Reliability
- Graceful handling of Govee API rate limits (10 req/min)
- Automatic reconnection after network interruptions
- Configuration backup and restore capability
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

## Out of Scope (V1)

- Integration with other calendar systems (Google, iCal)
- Support for other lighting brands
- Mobile companion app
- Multi-user household management
- Integration with other communication platforms (Slack, Zoom)
- Voice control integration
- HomeKit integration

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: User can immediately see their Teams status reflected in lighting
